The algorithm is provided in both .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) and .py (Python script) formats. The .py script is designed to run on a remote server environment. If you prefer to execute the code locally using the Jupyter Notebook, please note that you may remove or comment out the os.chdir("") line, as it is intended for setting the working directory on the remote server.
